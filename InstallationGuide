   (1) Download from GitHub
   ========================
   
   let call *root* the directory where you have extracted the gitHub files.
   you should get the following structure:
   - meta : the source code for the CLAIRE interpreter
   - compile : the source code for the CLAIRE compiler
   - src: the tree where all the go code may be found - 
          it contains a subdirectory for each CLAIRE module
            - Kernel : this is the heart of the CLAIRE go implementation (also called "micro CLAIRE")
            - Core, Language, Reader : the go code that was produced by compiling the files in meta
            - Optimize, Reader: the go code that was produced by compiling the files in compile
           It also contains the "system file" claire4.go
   - test : a directory with tests & examples
            - perf: the performance benchmark files
            - nonreg: non-regression test files
            
            
   The github also contains:
   -------------------------
   - README, installationGuide
   - the CLAIRE documentation (a PDF file)
   - init.cl : a CLAIRE init file that you may use to run the tests
   
   
   (2) Setting your own go compiling environment
   =============================================
   
   - select where you want to install the go files : the root directory *go* where you will do the go compiling
      Here I will show how to do it on a "go" subdirectory of *root* (i.e. *go* = *root*/go)
      However, this is your choice, but the GOPATH environment variable must be set :

   - set the env variable accordingly depending on your OS
        e.g. export GOPATH=*go*  on MacOS, set GOPATH=*go* on Windows, etc

   - On recent go versions, you need to set the GO111MODULE variable 
       export GO111MODULE=off
       read for more details  https://maelvls.dev/go111module-everywhere/

   - copy the go directories from *root* to *go*/src
        - the claire4.go file
        - all the subdirectories and their contents: Kernel, Core, Language, Reader, Optimize, Generate

    - build the claire4 executable:
        go build src/claire4.go
   
   
   (3) Get started with CLAIRE
   ===========================
   
   - claire4 will launch the interpreter.
     If an init.cl file is present, it will be loaded first
     modules are defined in the init file (think of it as a configuration file)
   
   - claire3 -cm <module> will compile a module into an executable
   
   
   (4) Playing with the demo performance tests 
   ===========================================
   
   test/perf contains a set of files : mFib, mList, MSet, MDict, mObj and mSend
   
   
   (5) Getting more confidence
   ===========================
   
   You may recompile CLAIRE easily
   - claire4 -cc <M> will compile a module M and place the generated go code under src/<M>
   - claire4 -sf <M> -o <name>  creates a "system file" that will include M and all its dependencies
   - go build src/<name>  will create an executable : this is how claire4 was built :)
